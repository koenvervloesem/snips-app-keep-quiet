**Important information: Following the acquisition of Snips by Sonos, the Snips Console is not available anymore after January 31, 2020. As such, we have exported all data of the English and German version of this app from the Snips Console and made these available in the directory [console](https://github.com/koenvervloesem/snips-app-keep-quiet/tree/master/console) with the same MIT license as the rest of this project. This project has been archived. If you're searching for an alternative to Snips, I believe that [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/) is currently the best choice for an offline open source voice assistant.**

With this [Snips](https://snips.ai/) app, you can ask your assistant to stop replying to your voice commands until you ask it to talk to you again. 

## Installation

The easiest way to install this app is by adding the corresponding Snips app to your assistant in the [Snips Console](https://console.snips.ai):

*   English: [Keep quiet](https://console.snips.ai/store/en/skill_134O6Yb4K6b)
*   French: [Mode silencieux](https://console.snips.ai/store/fr/skill_8lyE0KYQ1zr)
*   German: [Auszeit!](https://console.snips.ai/store/de/skill_zmmENzQnqaQ)

To be able to use this app, you need Snips 1.1.2 (0.62.3).

For disabling and enabling intents, the `snips-injection` service should be running, because the names of the installed intents are injected in the vocabulary of Snips.

## Usage

This app recognizes the following intents:

*   DisableIntent - You ask your assistant to disable an intent.
*   EnableIntent - You ask your assistant to enable an intent.
*   Quiet - You ask your assistant to stop replying to your voice commands. 
*   Talk - You ask your assistant to talk again.
